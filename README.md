# I2B2 setup

Migration scripts for setting up a simplified version of the I2B2 database.

## Introduction

Data Factory is a data management, quality control and data integration toolkit for curating data in order to be imported in the Medical Informatics Platform. In Data Factory, we use a database with a simplified -according to our needs- version of the original I2B2 schema so as to store and harmonize clinical data.

## Build

Run: `./build.sh`

## Test

Run: `cd tests && ./test.sh`
